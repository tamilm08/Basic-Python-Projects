# Alarm Clock with Tkinter

This is a simple alarm clock application built using Python's `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and `winsound` for playing the alarm sound. It allows you to set an alarm by selecting the hour, minute, and second, and once the time is reached, it will play a sound as an alarm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `tkinter`, `winsound`
- A `.wav` sound file to play when the alarm triggers (e.g., `sound.wav`)

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**
   - Download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Required Libraries**
   - The libraries used in this project are built-in Python libraries:
     - `tkinter` (for GUI)
     - `winsound` (for playing the alarm sound)
     - `time` and `datetime` (for time operations)
     - `threading` (for running the alarm in the background)

   No additional libraries are needed to install since these are part of the standard Python installation.

3. **Prepare the Sound File**
   - Ensure that you have a `.wav` sound file named `sound.wav` (or another `.wav` file of your choice) in the same directory as your script.
   - This file will be played when the alarm triggers.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**
   - Save the Python script (e.g., `alarm_clock.py`) in a directory of your choice.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:

   ```bash
   python alarm_clock.py
   ```

2. **Set the Alarm**
   - The GUI will open with three dropdown menus: Hour, Minute, and Second.
   - Select the time you want to set the alarm for.
   - Click the "Set Alarm" button to start the alarm clock.

3. **Wait for the Alarm**
   - The program will continuously check the current time in the background. Once the set time is reached, the alarm will trigger and a sound will play.
   
4. **Stop the Program**
   - You can stop the program by closing the Tkinter window. The background thread will automatically terminate when the main window is closed.

## Features

- **Alarm Time Setting**: Set the alarm time using dropdown menus for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Background Threading**: Uses a separate thread to check the time and trigger the alarm, keeping the GUI responsive.
- **Sound Alarm**: Plays a `.wav` sound when the set time is reached.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Sound**: Ensure that the sound file (`sound.wav`) is in the same directory as your script and that the file is valid.
- **Alarm Not Triggering**: Make sure the current system time matches the alarm time exactly. The alarm checks the time every second, so ensure that the selected time is in the correct format (HH:MM:SS).
- **GUI Freezes**: If the GUI freezes, ensure that threading is correctly set up to prevent the alarm check from blocking the GUI.
